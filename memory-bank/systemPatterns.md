# System Patterns: Math Invasion v2

*(To be filled in as patterns emerge)*

**Key Technical Decisions:**
*   Phaser 3 with Arcade Physics.
*   TypeScript for static typing.
*   Vite for build tooling.
*   Modular architecture separating core logic (`src/core`) from Phaser integration (`src/phaser`).
*   Configuration driven by YAML files (`config/`).
*   Event-driven communication via `EventBus`.

**Design Patterns:**
*   *(To be identified)*

**Component Relationships:**
*   *(To be documented, potentially with diagrams)*

**Critical Implementation Paths:**
*   Ensuring accurate physics/graphics synchronization.
*   Managing game state transitions (active, pause, game over).
*   Handling asynchronous operations (timers, API calls).
